Game Description:
After years of horrific warfare, you can still hear the screeching of bombers hurling down their missiles and the rumbling of tanks rolling across the farm lands that you used to call home even after the end of the Seventh Barbarian-Serpentine War. You have arisen in a world where morality has disintegrated entirely, and the scars of conflict cast a menacing shadow upon the lands of the once peaceful Holy Serpentine Empire. In this dark and twisted land, you must labor day-in and day-out to support your fellow impoverished boa constrictors who have been oppressed by the ruling class of elite cobras and vipers who have turned the husk that is the Empire into a rump state on the edge of collapsing to monitor lizard barbarians. You must work to feed your boa brothers by collecting the all-important food source of apples, which are all that remain as the upper-class.
